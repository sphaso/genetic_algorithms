# Genetic Algorithms

Implementing chapters from "Genetic algorithms in Elixir" by Sean Moriarity, except in Haskell.


## Chapter 1 and 2
These cover `onemax`, go through the commits to see the refactorings between the chapters.

The typeclass implementation is not quite as abstract as the one in the book, because I think the actual function implementation should stay in the Problem module.

## Chapter 3
This covers one last refactoring of `onemax` and introduces `speller`. Both are using the same `Types` idea from Chapter 2.
